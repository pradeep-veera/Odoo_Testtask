Add translation handling for urls generated by controller actions (only for the frontend)
Currently you can’t add translations to urls generated by controller actions.

For example you have a controller action:
 “/ecommerce/<int:ecommerce_id>”. The same url is used for all website languages with the language code as prefix, e. g. “de_DE/ecommerce/<int:ecommerce_id>”.

It would be nice if there is a list with all (or limited somehow) urls generated by controller actions in which the user can handle the url translations.

There are two major issues:
1.Provide a list of urls generated by controller actions. Research of the python werkzeug library is needed.
2.Extend the language switch behaviour. Currently the translations are ignored on the language switch, only the language code prefix is added.
